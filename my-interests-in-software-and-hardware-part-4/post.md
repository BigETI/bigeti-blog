This is the fourth part about my interests in software and hardware.

# Building and repairing PCs

Besides having interests in software, I did open, inspect and repair our own computers at home. This knowledge made me work at HOS Systemtechnik KG in Erkelenz where they sell computer related accessories, build and repair computers.

# Working on enterprise software

Aditionally upstairs at HOS Systemtechnik KG they had a software development department specialized in writing software to planning control cabinets. My knowledge in software development allowed me to work for their software packages and internal tooling. I have learned how **not** to run a software development team.

# Making games

## How it started

During the end of my work carreer as a enterprise software developer and at the beginning of my studies I was interested in making games. So I researched what I need to do to make games and so I released the game [Titros - A Tetris clone](https://www.indiedb.com/games/titros-a-tetris-clone) [(itch.io mirror)](https://bigeti.itch.io/titros). Later I have tried to work on an adventure game, which by its scope and lack of experience in game design and game arts unfortunately killed the project. From there I worked on badly designed game engines and badly designed game concepts. I have learned that I need to start small to grow bigger, learn about tools other game developers use and communicate with people who themselves work on games.

## Working in a team

At a game jam hosted by [TairaGames](https://tairagames.itch.io/) a few people and myself have assembled to work on a game called [The Iron Front](https://bigeti.itch.io/the-iron-front), in which you have to collect items during day to survive the night from the evil robots. This allowed me to gain experience in managing a team of game developers.

## Start small, grow big

From then on I have been working on prototypes like an anti-gravity vehicle racer, a fast-paced 2D ball plattformer, top-down racing game and small mobile games like [Cubed Snake](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BigETI.CubedSnake), [Jump Stack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BigETI.JumpStack), and [Bit Twister](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BigETI.BitTwister). I learned a lot about game engines, like workflows and good practices. For my studies I did work on games such as [Console Athlete](https://bigeti.itch.io/console-athlete), which is a console application using a renderer written in Câ™¯, [Bit Invasion](https://bigeti.itch.io/bit-invasion), which is a Space Invaders clone using Magicavoxel and Unity Game Engine, [Flying Rat](https://bigeti.itch.io/flying-rat), a Flappy Bird clone made within 10 hours, `Doughnuts, Go Nuts!`, a 2D platformer with dough physics, `@Home - Between Balconies`, a story driven game about people at their balconies during the Corona virus pandemic, [ElectrodZ](https://bzzzent.itch.io/electrodz), an online multiplayer game, [Sonar Spaceship](https://bigeti.itch.io/sonar-spaceship) a 2D audio-visuals game where you have to collect containers in space, and [The Dream of Yourself](https://bigeti.itch.io/the-dream-of-yourself), a game the discovery of the "other" in yourself, through a spiritual exploration of your subconsciousness.

## First commercial game

At our studies at [Cologne Game Lab](https://colognegamelab.de/), [igus](https://www.igus.de/) hosted a game jam to work on a game that represents [igus](https://www.igus.de/) product categories. After winning that game jam, we decided to work professionally with [igus](https://www.igus.de/) under the name [elads](https://elads.de/) on a game called [igumania](https://www.igus.de/info/igumania).
