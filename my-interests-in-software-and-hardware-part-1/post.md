Pretty early in my life I started to be interested in computers, especially how hardware works.

# Our first computer

Our, my sister's and my first computer was an IBM Windows 95 machine, which our father gifted us, who used it when Windows 3.1 came out, then later upgraded it to Windows 95. Later he bought a new machine capable of running Windows 98 and later pre-NT versions.

# Startup

When I booted up our computer, my first question was how does a computer know to show readable text and graphics. It took me years to figure out that programming languages exist to write code that tells a computer what they should do.

# No internet, still fun!

Even though we children did not have access to the internet, we could play around with that computer, like [Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint) to draw images, wich would be used for the desktop of that computer, [Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire) to play the famous deck of card game, a sidescrolling pace shooter which I forgot its name and [DEFRAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DOS_commands#DEFRAG) to see how our disk was being defragmented, which was very satisfying to look at.

# My dream to build my own robot

Some children say that they want to be firefighters, or nurses. Me on the other hand always wanted to build my own robot. I absolutely had no idea how I would start doing that. I asked my dad what I would need to fullfill my dream building a robot and he told me that I need to learn how to write software with a programming language. He knows a little bit of [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and [Turbo Pascal](https://turbo51.com/pascal-programming-language), but he could never teach me how to write software.
