This is the third part about my interests in software and hardware.

# Working with multiplayer gaming communities

Back then I did play **A LOT** of GTA III, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas on Playstation 2. The story modes and the ability to mess around inside the game worlds is a lot of fun. Years later a friend of mine showed me GTA San Andreas for PC and I knew that there is a co-op mode on Playstation 2. I looked up for `GTA San Andreas Multiplayer` and the first result was a link to a mod called [San Andreas Multiplayer](https://www.sa-mp.com/). I did play a lot on freeroam and team death-match servers. I have made friends and together we did work on our own servers.

# Practicing, practicing and practicing

When I was 17 I started to gain more interest in learning programming languages, starting with C, because C is used to make applications, C++, because it seems to be a better and more modern alternative to C, Java, because it runs on every machine, VBA for automating Microsoft Office documents, Pawn to write game modes for a multiplayer mod called [San Andreas Multiplayer](https://www.sa-mp.com/) and so on.

## Execute, fail, learn and repeat

From there I started to write game modes, plugins, console applications, GUI apps and experimented in writing game engines. Most of the tools are considered useless or lack good design, which made me aware that the first software you are writing will never be the best work of yours. Re-writing old code and applying better practices to projects became my workflow which I practice nowadays.

# Open-sourcing projects

For years I have been writing software that were not properly versioned and plagued with bad coding practices and were totally closed-source. At some point I started to use Git to version my work, learn good coding practices by talking to other developers in the internet and open-sourcing software at [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/BigETI/), [GitHub](https://github.com/BigETI) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/BigETI), so people can look at them and contribute to them.
