Hello, my name is Ethem Kurt and welcome to my blog.

Sit down, relax, grab a cup of coffee or tea and let's get started!

# Who am I?

My name is Ethem Kurt, born at 9th May 1993 and I am from Erkelenz, Germany.

# Where do I live right now?

Now I am residing in Alicante, Spain with my future wife KÃ¡theryn.

# Do we have any plans for our life?

Our plans are to work hard for our common goals to achieve a good life for atleast both of us.

# What is my specialization?

I am very good at designing and [writing software](https://github.com/BigETI), especially in [making video games](https://bigeti.itch.io).

My skills come from dedicating my time to software and game development as a hobby and by working for companies.

I am able to find solutions to problems easily, abstract and generalize ideas, manage, collaborate and communicate with other team members.

# What are my hobbies?

I love to play and make video games, analyze and speculate how systems work, spend time with family and friends and bike long distances.

# What are you doing right now?

Now I will dedicate my time on working on my own brand, working with companies by innovating ideas and working environments, manage my own video games studio and trying out new ideas that could be successful in the future.
