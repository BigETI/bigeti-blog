This is the second part about my interests in software and hardware.

# Controller re-mapping and automation

## Working for my Nintendo Wii

When I was 13 the Nintendo Wii has been released. I worked for it by collecting bottles at school, which students threw away or gifted me because they knew that I was collecting bottles. In Germany for a recycling bottle you get 0.25â‚¬, therefore it would take me around 1000 bottles to collect and give them to recycling stations at supermarkets. I needed my mother to come with me buying a Nintendo Wii, since I needed atleast one parent next to me to do business with the store called Media Markt. I was proud to give them cash from my pocket, when the cashier asked my mother to pay for the Nintendo Wii.

## Wiimote for PC?

Pretty early I wanted to use the bundled Wiimote with our computer to play games or control it with it like my Wii. After searching through the internet what I need to use my Wiimote on my computer, I would need a tool called [GlovePIE](https://github.com/Ravbug/GlovePIE) and a bluetooth dongle. [GlovePIE](https://github.com/Ravbug/GlovePIE) allows for example to map button on a Wiimote to a keyboard, mouse or gamepad, which means I can finally control games using my Wiimote. Also GlovePIE allows for more advanced logic, which enabled me to write scripts and practice how to automate stuff using software.

# Dark past

There was a time where I dd not want to pursue anything related to computers. I was more like into going out with friends and not being a contributor of our society.

# You need to study to work here!

## My interests came back

At school we had to look for workplaces to train us for the future. For two weeks we had to work to gain some working experience and since I already did work at a bakery before, and I wanted to work at an office, I decided to work where my father works. He works at SIEMENS AG in Duisburg as an oil pump engineer at his office. Next to his old department there was the SPS team, who wrote automation software for gigantic SIEMENS machines. I got pretty excited to work with the SPS team and my first task was more like a playground for me to understand how SPS works. Initially they did not want me to write any useful software, since I was just the youngest man there. However after writing some fun softare for a SPS emulator an actual SPS machine, the lead software developer tasked me with a job for an old oil pump in Munich. It did not take much time to write this software according to the specs for a cycle-accurate emulator, the software update has been deployed to the machine using an old analogue modem.

## You need to study!

At the last day at SIEMENS I asked the department leader if I can work there, and he told me that they only accept people who studied at an university. For this I need to have good grades at school and visit good schools. Back then I did not care much about school, because it was very boring and did not seem important for me, but that gave me a boost to continue with school and later study at an university.
